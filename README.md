A command line Java program that tests the performance of some Collections classes. The user chooses to either add or retrieve a number of elements using three different collections classes: ArrayList, HashSet, and LinkedList. The program times how long it takes the computer to complete these operations and produces a simple histogram. The program scales the histograms to between 0 and 54 points.
